UC2 - Equality Comparison
This use case implements equality comparison for:

Feet
Inches
Objects are created using: Feet.fromString("1.0"); Inches.fromString("1.0");

Invalid numeric input throws a custom exception.

Equality Rules
Same value → true
Different value → false
Null → false
Same reference → true
Different class → false
Tech
Java, JUnit 5

UC3 – Generic Quantity Class (DRY Principle)
Description
UC3 refactors separate Feet and Inches classes into a single generic Quantity class using a LengthUnit enum.
This eliminates code duplication and follows the DRY principle.

How It Works
User enters value and unit (feet/inch).
Values are converted to a common base unit (feet).
Equality is checked using value-based comparison.
Key Concepts
DRY Principle
Enum Usage
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Proper equals() contract
Cross-unit comparison (1 foot = 12 inches)

👉 UC-3

Quantity Measurement – UC4
Supported Units
Feet
Inch
Yard
Centimeter
Features
Takes input from user
Converts units internally
Checks if two values are equal
Supports cross-unit comparison
Example
1 Feet = 12 Inch 3 Feet = 1 Yard 2.54 Centimeter = 1 Inch

UC5 – Unit-to-Unit Conversion
UC5 adds direct conversion between length units using a common base unit.

Supported Units
FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS

Features
Static convert(value, source, target) method
Instance convertTo() method
Base unit normalization
Input validation (null, NaN, infinite)
Immutable value object
Formula
result = value × (source.factor / target.factor)
Example
1 FEET → INCHES = 12
3 YARDS → FEET = 9
36 INCHES → YARDS = 1

UC6 – Addition of Two Length Units
UC6 extends UC5 by adding support for addition of two length measurements (same category).

Supported Units
FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS

Features
Add two Length objects
Automatic unit conversion before addition
Result returned in unit of first operand
Uses base unit normalization (FEET)
Immutable design (returns new object)
Input validation for null, NaN, infinite values
Logic
Convert both lengths to base unit (FEET)
Add values
Convert sum back to first operand’s unit
Return new Length object
Example
1 FEET + 2 FEET = 3 FEET
1 FEET + 12 INCHES = 2 FEET
12 INCHES + 1 FEET = 24 INCHES
1 YARD + 3 FEET = 2 YARDS

24.0 inches
0.6666666666666666 yards

UC8 – Standalone LengthUnit Refactoring
Description
UC8 refactors the design by extracting LengthUnit into a standalone enum and assigning it full responsibility for unit conversions.

Key Improvements
LengthUnit handles all conversion logic
Quantity handles comparison and arithmetic
Follows Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Removes circular dependency risk
Improves scalability for future units (Weight, Volume, etc.)
Fully backward compatible with UC1–UC7
Supported Units
FEET
INCHES
YARDS
CENTIMETERS
Example Output
Convert 1 FEET to INCHES:
12.0 inches

Add 1 FEET + 12 INCHES (in FEET):
2.0 feet

Add 1 FEET + 12 INCHES (in YARDS):
0.6666666666666666 yards

36 INCHES equals 1 YARDS?
true
Architecture
Base Unit: FEET

Conversion delegated to LengthUnit

Equality uses epsilon comparison

UC9 – Weight Measurement
Description
UC9 extends the Quantity Measurement Application to support Weight Measurements alongside Length.

Supported Units:

KILOGRAM (kg) – Base unit
